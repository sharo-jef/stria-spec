# Stria Language Specification

This repository contains the official specification definition for the Stria programming language.

## About Stria

Stria is a declarative, schema-validated configuration management language designed for creating robust and maintainable configuration systems with strong type safety and validation capabilities.

### Etymology

The name "Stria" comes from three roots: **Structura** (Latin: Structure), **Via** (Latin: Path/Way), and **Strict** (English: Rigorous) - representing a strict structure and clear path for configuration management.
